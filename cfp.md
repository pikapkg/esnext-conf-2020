- Talks should be 25 minutes long. If you have a REALLY good reason to go longer or shorter, let us know in your submission.

## Who we are looking for

There are a few things we are **NOT** looking for:

- Intro talks (Getting started with framework Y)
- Negative talks (All the things I hate about Z)
- Comparing frameworks (Why I think E is better than F)

What we _are_ looking for, is your answer to this question: **What big changes will happen to the JavaScript ecosystem in the next 5 years?**

**A great talk tells a story.** Predicting and exploring the future of the web today is an exciting proposition, but also be sure to tie your story back to the present. How can this secret knowledge that you've uncovered about the future help your audience _today?_

Below are a few topics that we think are interesting, and would love to see proposals around:

- The death of IE11
- The birth of HTTP/2 & HTTP/3
- Svelte, HTM, and other innovative takes on component development
- Next.js, Gatsby, and any innovative takes on application development
- Decentralized Web (IPFS, dat, etc)
- The future of work (remote or otherwise)
- Building more inclusive technical communities and a healthier industry
- Developer Ethics
- Security, Privacy and Trust
- Accessibility
- Going beyond touch & text (e.g. AR/VR, voice interfaces)
- Web platform (Web Assembly, latest additions)
- Performance (Bonus if told as a part of another story)
- Serverless

## Should I submit a talk?

Yes! This CFP is open to both experienced speakers and folks who have never given a big conference talk. The criteria we will use for evaluating submissions will be the same, and no added weight will be awarded to folks just because they've spoken before.

ESNEXT is a global conference. We're looking to present live talks across multiple time zones and countries. We request that all talk submissions are made in English, but if you'd like to give your talk in any other language just let us know in the submission and we do our best to accommodate you.

## Code of conduct

Please review our [Code of Conduct](/coc). Everyone who participates in our conference agrees to the enforcement of our CoC, and includes our friends, speakers, staff, sponsors, and attendees.

## What we take care of

If we accept your proposal to speak, the following items are taken care of by us:

- Two free tickets to watch the conference: one for you, and 1 for a friend/coworker.
- A 50%-off link to tickets that you can share with anyone else!
- A professional webcam and microphone will be shipped to you before your talk, unless you feel you already have one. We do this because we want you to be able to give the best talk you can give, and we know that your audience will appreciate it.
- We can also provide a green screen, if you feel comfortable setting it up to record (we'll provide some basic instructions). Don't hesitate to get creative :D
- A few extra surprises!

Don't worry about shipping anything back after you've given your talk. It's always a good idea to have a nice microphone and camera lying around, and we hope you'll find good use for them in the future.

### Note for ASL speakers

If you would like to deliver your talk using ASL, we are here we to support you! Once your proposal has been accepted, we will work with you to figure out the best way to make sure your talk is delivered appropriately to folks in our audience who don't understand ASL.

For the CFP "Past presentation example" field, feel free to include any video using ASL and include an attached transcript. Our Talk Review Committee will use both to video and the transcript to evaluate your proposal.

### We’re here to help!

There are a million reasons why you might not think you’re qualified or capable of giving a talk, let alone at ESNEXT. If you have an interesting insight into the future of the web, **we want to hear your story.**

If you are a new speaker, once your talk has been accepted we will commit to working with you to give an awesome talk. This includes reviewing and advising on slides and helping you practice giving your talk. Whatever else you might need, we’re here to help.

## The selection process

Submissions close on <span class="exclaim">April 3, 2020</span>. We will get back to all speakers as soon as possible. We will email all speakers at roughly the same time, so everyone will hear back on the same day.
