        <section class="section">
          <h2 id="recording" class="is-size-2">📹 Recording your talk</h2>
          <p>
            You should have heard from us already about getting you a microphone
            & webcam if you need one (contact us if you haven’t!).
          </p>
          <p>
            All talks at ESNext Conf will be pre-recorded by you ahead of time.
            <strong>We strongly recommend Loom</strong> (Free,
            <a href="https://loom.com">loom.com</a>) for all talk recordings.
            Loom is great because it records your screen and your webcam at the
            same time with no advanced editing skills required. We strongly
            recommend using Loom’s
            <a href="https://loom.com/downloads">Desktop app</a> over their
            Chrome Extension.
          </p>
          <p>Some tips for getting the most out of Loom:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you start a recording, make sure your good webcam and
              microphone are selected! It can be all too easy to finish a
              recording, play it back, and realize the wrong audio/video was
              selected.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can trim the beginning/ending of the video in Loom, so don’t
              worry spending a few seconds to get the presentation set up.
            </li>
            <li>
              Record your entire window, as if you were giving a presentation at
              a conference (i.e. don’t record a scaled-down window, as the final
              resolution will be too small). Having a 2nd screen can help with
              this in case you need to see speaker notes, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Be sure to make sure your final video, trimmed, clocks in at 25
            minutes long, and
            <strong
              >📆 send us a link to your video by Fri, Jul 10 at the
              latest</strong
            >
            and we’ll take care of the rest. Send us a link even earlier than
            that if you’d like feedback!
          </p>

          <h3 class="is-size-4">
            What if I want to use something other than Loom?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We recommend Loom because it produces a consistent format without a
            lot of work. But if you want to handle video editing and preparation
            yourself, please make sure you meet the following criteria:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Final video is 25 minutes long (same as Loom)</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Show your face and your screen at the same time!</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Video: MP4 (H.264) format @ 24 FPS or higher (60 FPS preferred)
            </li>
            <li>Audio: MPEG format</li>
            <li>
              Minimum resolution: 1920×1080 (16:9 HD), but we’ll take 3840×2160
              (16:9 4K) if you’re able to produce that!
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>
                    we’re not going to be sticklers on the aspect ratio—if 4:3
                    is easier for you to record that’s fine, too, just so long
                    as it’s horizontal</em
                  >
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t worry about filesize or compression (in fact, we’d prefer
              you compress the video the least amount possible)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Send us your video <strong>no later than Wed, July 8</strong> (send
            us a link via Dropbox, or however you transfer large files). Note
            that this is <strong>earlier than the Loom deadline</strong> as we
            may need extra time to review & make sure the video will work for
            the conference stream (checking audio levels, etc.).
          </p>

          <h3 class="is-size-4">
            Are there any other stylistic details?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our only stylistic recommendation if you’re editing it yourself is
            <strong>keep one continuous take</strong> just like a conference
            talk. It’s OK if you make a little mistake here and there, just like
            a live presentation! We feel it’s more natural and more fun to
            watch.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond that, try to be yourself and capture your own conference
            speaking style, whatever that means! We know the energy is different
            without a live audience, but little details like opening with a
            greeting (“Hello, ES Next Conf!”) and having a defined signoff
            (”…and that concludes [topic]. Thanks for having me!”) can help it
            feel more like a conference talk and less like a studio video.

          <h2 id="conference" class="is-size-2">🗣️ Conference format</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We’ll have an active Discord group for discussing individual talks
              as well as general group discussions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every day: We’ll stream ~3 talks per day via YouTube Live, with an
              MC to introduce each talk and guide the audience through the day.
            </li>
            <li>
              After each talk: we’ll run a quick speaker AMA on Discord about
              the talk (if able to attend; if not, we can have those async!).
            </li>
            <li>
              During the conference: watch! Interact with guests! You can answer
              as many or few questions as you’d like, and interact as much as
              little as you like. Totally up to what you feel comfortable with.
            </li>
            <li>
              Afterward: we’ll upload the talks to Pika’s YouTube channel after
              the conference is over.
            </li>
            <li>
              Afterward: we’ll donate 100% of ticket proceeds to organizations
              helping in the fight against COVID-19
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You can optionally choose to allocate 5% of proceeds to a
                  local foundation or charity of your choice. We’ll ask you
                  about this in a future survey.
