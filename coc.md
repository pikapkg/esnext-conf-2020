# The ESNext Conf Code of Conduct

> Based on the [CascadiaJS CoC](https://github.com/cascadiajs/cascadiajs-2020/blob/master/src/views/pages/content/coc.md) (MIT).

We take community safety very seriously and want to preserve that at all costs.

Everyone, including attendees, sponsors, speakers, and organizers, is required to agree to and follow this Code of Conduct. Inappropriate behavior and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant. This includes any online or in-person interaction surrounding our events, from the livestream itself to using social sites, including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub.

ESNext Conf is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference for all attendees, regardless of gender identity, sex, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, physical appearance, or body size. Harassment includes: prejudicial verbal or written comments, sexual imagery in public spaces or inappropriate use of nudity (including in presentation slides), deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sponsors and speakers should not use sexualized or inappropriate images, activities, or other material in their advertisements or talks. All participants, including volunteers, should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment. We reserve the right to review all materials and remove them from distribution if they are determined to be inappropriate.

Finally, anything that would make someone think ”Hmmm, that’s inappropriate” may also be unacceptable behavior.

## Reporting

If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact [info@pika.dev](mailto:info@pika.dev) and we’ll resolve the situation immediately.

## Enforcement

Any violation of these rules will result in action by conference organizers. Though a warning may be issued in some instances, some situations may require immediate expulsion. Violation may also result in being prohibited from future ESNext Conf / Pika events as well.

Thank you for helping us make ESNext Conf a safe and inclusive experience.
